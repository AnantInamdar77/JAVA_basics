# Java Basics and DSA Practice

This repository is for practicing **Java programming** concepts and learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. 

## About

In this repo, I will be:
- Revisiting Java basics like variables, control flow, functions, and object-oriented programming.
- Practicing common **Data Structures** such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- Implementing and understanding popular **Algorithms** including sorting and searching techniques.

   - Arrays

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Classes and Objects
   - Inheritance and Polymorphism

3. **Data Structures**
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists
   - Stacks and Queues

4. **Algorithms**
